HIGH:

* Implement background error reporting for bound scripts.
  Possibly provide for disabling of scripts on errors.

* Implement test suite.

(Completing of these two points will allow to release a
preliminary working binary release which can be immediately
used in production for simple cases.)

NORMAL:

* Implement %-expansion of bound scripts.

* Module documentation.

LOW:

* Substitute Tk binding handling with regular hashes
  and drop dependence on Tk.

* Figure out how to enable linking against Unicode Win32 API.

* Code cleanup and comments.

? Implement wrapper subrommands for some "active" relevant Win32
  API calls for shutting down the system, logging off the user,
  etc.

? Possibly rename the project to tclwinsm (Windows Session
  Management).
