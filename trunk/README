This package exports some mechanics of Win32 API related to
Windows power management and session management to the Tcl
script level.

By using this package arbitrary Tcl scripts can be bound to
such events like "the system switched from the AC power to the
battery", "the user is about to log off", "system battery
low", "resumed from suspended state" and so on. The management
of such scripts are modelled after the Tk [bind] command.

Introspection capabilities to analyze the events being
processed as well as the system's power status are provided.

Refer to the provided HTML documentation for more info.

The package is written by
Konstantin Khomoutov <flatworm@users.sourceforge.net>
and it is hosted at http://tkwinpm.googlecode.com

This package is distributed under pretty the same license as
Tcl itself.
