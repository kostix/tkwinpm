HIGH:

* Module documentation.

* Check the format of [winpm info power] return value:
  it seems that some info (number of secs of batt life is
  different that of stated in the documentation).

* Write tests for handling of the case "appending a script when
  there's no script currently bound".

* Drop "generate" subcommand since it's no more really needed
  since there's "_injectwm" subcommand.

NORMAL:

* Implement %-expansion of bound scripts.

LOW:

* Substitute Tk binding handling with regular hashes
  and drop dependence on Tk.

* Figure out how to enable linking against Unicode Win32 API.
  (Is it really needed? If we pass some sorts of string data to
  it, we must ensure it's USC-2 when using Unicode API.)

* Code cleanup and comments.

? Implement wrapper subrommands for some "active" relevant Win32
  API calls for shutting down the system, logging off the user,
  etc.

? Possibly rename the project to tclwinsm (Windows Session
  Management).
